# About

**WHO?** I am a researcher at the intersection of **cognitive science **and **judgment and decision making**.

**WHAT? **I research how to **improve human judgment and decision making**. To this end I combine insights from cognitive science, bounded rationality, heuristics, collective intelligence ("wisdom of crowds"), data science, and machine learning.

**WHERE? **I work at the [Center for Adaptive Rationality (ARC)][0] at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin (MPIB)][1]

**WHERE ONLINE? **You can find me at my [work website][2], on [GoogleScholar][3], on[Research Gate][4] and on [LinkedIn][5].
