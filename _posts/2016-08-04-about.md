# About

## Who?

I am a researcher at the intersection of **cognitive science**and **judgment and decision making** (see my [CV][0]).

## What?

I research how to **improve human judgment and decision making**. To this end I combine insights from cognitive science, bounded rationality, heuristics, collective intelligence ("wisdom of crowds"), data science, and machine learning.

## Where?

I work at the **[Center for Adaptive Rationality (ARC)][1]** at the **[Max Planck Institute for Human Development][2]**[in Berlin (MPIB)][2]

## Where online?

You can find me at my [work website][3], on [GoogleScholar][4], on[Research Gate][5] and on [LinkedIn][6].
